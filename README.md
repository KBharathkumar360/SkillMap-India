### Data Processing

- **NLP for Skill Extraction**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were applied to extract the required skills from job descriptions (JDs). This involved identifying and standardizing the skill names mentioned in the job postings.
- The scraped data was cleaned and preprocessed before being grouped into **10 clusters** using the **K-Means** clustering algorithm.
- **Optimal Number of Clusters**: The optimal number of clusters was determined using the **Elbow Method** and the **Silhouette Score**, ensuring meaningful groupings of job roles.

### Skills Dataset

- **Data_Job_Skillsets.txt**: This file contains a list of valid skillsets associated with various job categories. The skills were standardized to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.
